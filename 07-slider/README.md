# Slider App

This app features a dynamic image slider that allows users to :

- navigate through a list of people.
- navigate manually or let the slider automatically transition between slides at regular intervals.

There are two approaches taken in this project to set up the slider, the hardcoded one implemented in the "Carousel" component, and the one using React Slick library implemented in the "SlickCarousel" component.
